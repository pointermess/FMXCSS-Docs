# FMXCSS-Docs

FMXCSS is a text-based stylesheet system
for Firemonkey. It allows you to write 
complete styling definitions for every
Firemonkey control (including the form
border) and custom style definitions in a
"CSS-like" sytanx which was customized to
fit the Firemonkey styling system. If
you know css and the Firemonkey styling
system, you should be able to use FMXCSS.

The system is in a very early concept stage
and the executable was provided only at
selected places to receive direct feedback.

If you want to read more about the potential 
future of this project, please rdfer to
the Roadmap.
